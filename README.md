# Consulate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kadaan/consulate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kadaan/consulate) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/kadaan/consulate/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/kadaan/consulate) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kadaan/consulate)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kadaan/consulate)

Consulate provides a normalized HTTP endpoint that responds with
200 / non-200 according to Consul checks specified in the requested URL.
This endpoint can then be composed with existing HTTP based monitoring tools, like
AWS ELB health checks, to enable service monitoring based on Consul checks.

## Building from source

To build Consulate from the source code yourself you need to have a working
Go environment with [version 1.9 or greater installed](http://golang.org/doc/install).

```console
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/kadaan
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kadaan
$ git clone https://github.com/kadaan/consulate.git
$ cd consulate
$ ./build.sh
```

## Routes

All routes respond to both GET and HEAD requests.  They accept the following query string parameters:

1. `pretty`: when present, pretty prints json responses
1. `verbose`: when present, additional details are include in responses

## Verify

Consulate verifies Consul checks by inspecting the status.  The possible status values, in increasing severity are:

* `passing`
* `maintenance`
* `warning`
* `critical`

By default, verification will fail checks whose status is not `passing`.

This can be changed by specifying the `status` query string parameter like `?status=warning`.  Only checks whose status is worse than the specified value will cause a failure.

The following table shows all possible status query string parameter values and, as a result, which checks will be considered failing. 

| Status Query String Parameter                | Fails When                       | Default? |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| _Not specified_ or `?status=passing`         | Check is not `passing`           | Yes      |
| `?status=maintenance`                        | Check is `warning` or `critical` | No       |
| `?status=warning`                            | Check is `critical`              | No       |
| `?status=critical`                           | Never                            | No       |

### `/verify/checks`

The `/verify/checks` route returns 200 if all Consul checks ok.  Otherwise, a non-200 status code is returned and the failing checks will be in the response.

##### Request
```console
curl -X GET http:/localhost:8080/verify/checks\?pretty

## Overhead

In it's standard configuration Consulate adds very little overhead to the system and to Consul.  Caching is used to reduce the calls to Consul to one per second.  The processing done in Consulate is CPU bound, but is not very intensive.

Performance testing was done with [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta). 
```console
$ echo "GET http://localhost:8080/verify/checks" | vegeta attack -duration=5m | tee results.bin | vegeta report
